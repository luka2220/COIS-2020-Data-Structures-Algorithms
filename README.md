# COIS-2020-Data-Structures-Algorithms
All notes and code from COIS 2020 Trent University

## Course Description
Data structures and algorithms are two fundamental, but mutually dependent, areas of Computer
Science.  They correspond closely and respectively to the data members and methods of a class
in C#.  The data structures are concerned with how the data associated with classes are
represented, and the algorithms are concerned with how the data structures are manipulated
using methods.
Always keeping in mind the underlying concepts of abstraction, encapsulation, and information
hiding, the course challenges you to carefully consider which data structures and algorithms best

## Course Sections
